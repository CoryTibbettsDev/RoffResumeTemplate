# A Roff Résumé Template
Need Troff implementation to compile such as groff or neatroff.<br  \>
For some github doesn't allow to to put accents in repository names :(

# Compilation
Run `make` or `groff -T pdf -K utf8 resume.roff > resume.pdf`

# Helpful Roff Resume Examples

## Groff
[Probably the best one](https://old.reddit.com/r/groff/comments/n7vigw/template_modern_good_looking_resumes_ms_macros/)<br  />
[Two](https://github.com/glaso95/Resume)<br  />
[Three](https://github.com/nacro90/cvroff)<br  />

# Neatroff
[Really nice but has to be compiled with neatroff](https://github.com/Gavinok/neatroff_res)
